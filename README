*** swak4FoamParsers
    The basis of =swak4Foam=: the expression parsers with the logic to
    access the /OpenFOAM/ data-structures.

    None of the other software pieces compile without it
*** groovyBC
    Implements the infamous =groovyBC=. A boundary condition that
    allows arbitrary expressions in the field-file
*** simpleSwakFunctionObjects
    Function objects based on the =simpleFunctionObjects=-library
    (which is a prerequisite for compiling it)
** Utilities
*** funkySetFields
    Utility that allows creation and manipulation of files with
    expressions 
*** replayTransientBC
    Utility to quickly test whether a groovyBC gives the expected
    results. Writes the specified fields with the applied boundary
    condition but doesn't do anything else.

    Can be used for other BCs as well
** Examples
